# Project 3 Kitties Carousel

## Part 1 Create carousel effect
<a href="assets">These four image assets</a> are used. The carousel fills the browser horizontally. Each image stays on screen for 2 seconds before sliding off.

## Part 2 Make dot-indicators

<img src="carousel.gif">

## Part 3 Make the dots navigatable
The dots are clickable. When a user clicks a dot that is not lit up, the corresponding image slides in from the right. The image slides in from the right even if its dot is to the left of the one that was lit up when the user clicks.
