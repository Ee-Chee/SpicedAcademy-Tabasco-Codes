# SPICED Academy

[SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/program/full-stack-web-development) is a 12-week coding bootcamp located in Berlin. The full-stack web development course started from 25th Feb 2019 until 17th May 2019. 16 students participated in this course and the cohort was named as Tabasco. 

During these 12 weeks, we learned the popular technologies of web-coding intensively, from back-end to front-end coding. The details of the 12-week curriculum can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/Ee-Chee/SpicedAcademy-Tabasco-Curriculum).

This repo shows only the projects and exercises that I had completed during the first 6 weeks of the course.
